# DirectX Model Viewer

A simple model viewer made with DirectX 11 and Dear ImGui (v1.77) with the purpose of learning both of them.

It builds with Visual Studio 2019 (v142) and the Windows SDK v10.0, although any version of those that supports DirectX 11 should work.

It is still not finished though, however I managed to integrate Dear ImGui so it shouldn't take long before it is.
